        <h2>A Nighttime Wonder</h2>
        <p>Shelma, oh Shelma, you're a sight to behold<br>
            With a smile so pretty, it's worth more than gold<br>
            Incredible and adorable, you truly are<br>
            And I can't help but admire you from afar<br><br>
            
            Under the night sky, with the moon shining bright<br>
            And stars twinkling like diamonds, a beautiful sight<br>
            I think of you and your radiance, so rare<br>
            Your beauty shines brighter than any star up there<br><br>
            
            The moon casts a glow on your lovely face<br>
            And the stars twinkle in admiration and grace<br>
            I can't help but feel the magic of the night<br>
            And dream of holding you close, everything feeling just right<br><br>
            
            You make the night sky pale in comparison<br>
            Your charm and grace leave me in fascination<br>
            I wish I could tell you how pretty you are<br>
            And how you light up the world like a shining star<br><br>
            
            Every time I see you, my heart skips a beat<br>
            Your beauty and grace, oh so sweet<br>
            I can't help but stare in awe and wonder<br>
            And wish that we could be together<br><br>
            
            The moon and stars above can attest<br>
            To the beauty you possess, it's the best<br>
            And as we stand here under the night sky<br>
            I can't help but think, you're the reason why<br><br>
            
            Shelma, oh Shelma, you're a treasure to find<br>
            And I hope that we can leave these doubts behind<br>
            Under the night sky, with the moon and stars<br>
            I'll cherish you always, no matter where we are.<br><br></p>
